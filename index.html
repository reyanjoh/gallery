                <!-- This makes your special day more personalized! Ritz and Rach's wedding is a great example. For their wedding aisle d√©cor, French urns in patina finish were used. The beautiful part about this piece is the  phrase Ritz uttered to Rach when he proposed, ‚ÄúTayo naman, Mrs. San Juan.‚Äù You'll also notice origami flowers as part of the decorations, because back when they were college sweethearts, Ritz surprised Rach with a dozen paper tulips. How romantic is that?! As for the reception styling, a couple of geometric centerpieces were included as a nod to the venue where Ritz popped the question. The meaning behind every detail makes this wedding even more vibrant! Enjoy scrolling through these photos by Captured Moments Studios -->
